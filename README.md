# IP-Address-Tracker

## Link to Deployed Application

## Description

This application uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and 2 APIs. One is a server-side API which collects IP-adresses and gives information such as, location, ISP, and timezone. In addition, I used the
LeafletJS map API which allows the user to have a visual representation of the data. A user will enter any IP addresse or domain and see the key information and location on the map. Furthermore, 
the user will see their own IP address on the map on the initial page load.
